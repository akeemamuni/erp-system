# Enterprise Resource Planning System

This project is a modular monolith ERP system built to demonstrate enterprise-grade architecture with a clear path from MVP to production-scale deployment.  

It is designed for local-first development using Docker Compose and a clean monorepo structure (Nx), prioritizing modularity, tenant isolation, and maintainability.  

The system includes core business modules such as Inventory, Procurement, Finance, and HR, and is designed to support PostgreSQL multi-tenancy, RBAC, and API gateway routing.
